FEM grain structure strain energy minimizer

Given a grain structure such as like this where each grain can have 1...N grain different grain strains.
![grains](https://github.com/ManuelPetersmann/FEM_grain_structure_strain_energy_minimizer/blob/master/img17.png =250x250)

and under suitable boundary conditions such as periodic boundary conditions, or like here embedding the grain structure inta a matrix

the given phython scripts transform each grain, one by one, trying out all
