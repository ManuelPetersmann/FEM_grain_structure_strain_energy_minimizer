FEM grain structure strain energy minimizer

Given a grain structure such as like this where each grain can have 1...N grain different grain strains.

and under suitable boundary conditions such as periodic boundary conditions, or like here embedding the grain structure inta a matrix

the given phython scripts transform each grain, one by one, trying out all
